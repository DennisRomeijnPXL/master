## LAB 1 - Python Experiments

### 1.1 task preperation and implementation

I would have to do research on how to install all these tools/packages
sources: <br>
https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/linux/ <br>
https://jupyter.org/install <br>
https://www.python.org/downloads/

### 1.1 task troubleshooting:

at first there were some problems with the dependencies that python requires, so I would have to start from scratch so to be able to fix the issues.

### 1.2 task preperation and implementation

At the beginning we would have to get the code from the github repository and place it in a file on our DEVASC machine. After that we use python3 (file) to activate said file.
